# Extension Icons

This folder should contain PNG icons for the browser extension.

## Required Icons

Create or add the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should:
- Have a transparent background
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Use the ScamCap brand colors (shield/security theme recommended)

## Quick Solution

If you don't have custom icons yet, you can:

1. Use a free icon generator like:
   - https://icon.kitchen/
   - https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/

2. Or create simple icons using any image editor

3. Save them as PNG files with the exact names above

## Temporary Fix

Until you have proper icons, the extension will work without them but may show a default icon in the browser toolbar.
